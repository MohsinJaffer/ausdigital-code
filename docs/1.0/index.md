## Introduction

This specification lists standard code lists (eg the ISO-3166 coutnry code list), their extensions and JSON representation for them.

## UBL Syntax 1.0 Code Lists representation

The UBL Syntax 1.0 Code List is presented in UBL [Genericode](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html)

The [UBL Syntax 1.0 Standard Code Lists](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-code/blob/syn-v1/master/codes/standard)

The [UBL Syntax 1.0 Extended Code Lists](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-code/blob/syn-v1/master/codes/extended)

## UBL Syntax 2.0 Code Lists representation

The UBL Syntax 2.0 Code List representation in JSON format provides an alternative to the UBL [Genericode](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html)
